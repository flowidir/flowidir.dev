# Conventions

A lot of Remix APIs aren't imported from the `"remix"` package, but are instead conventions and exports from _your_ application modules. When you `import from "remix"`, _you are calling Remix_, but these APIs are when _Remix calls your code_.
This file has a few build and development configuration options, but does not actually run on your server.

### routes

A function for defining custom routes, in addition to those already defined
using the filesystem convention in `app/routes`. Both sets of routes will be merged.
