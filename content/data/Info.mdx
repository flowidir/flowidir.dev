#

# I'm a self-taught full-stack developer based in Florida, USA.

I have multiple years of experience in the JavaScript ecosystem and have a blog where I write about technology, share the things I've learned, and ponder the future of the field.

I am passionate about building things for the web, writing clean & maintainable code, and keeping up with the newest technology trends while looking ahead to what's on the horizon.
